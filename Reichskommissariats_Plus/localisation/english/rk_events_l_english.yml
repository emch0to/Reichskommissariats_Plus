As our soldiers began to tackle the ever-growing Italian resistance, the Reichstag has been advocating for a new Reichskommissariat to be installed in Rome. This will surely be unpopular and hated amongst the Italian populace. \n\nWhile we could just go ahead and prepare the plan, our old friend Benito Mussolini is in custody and awaiting trials. It might be naive but we could install him as a puppet leader of the Italian Social Republic. This is highly unpopular in the Reichstag as the parliament wanted him gone. However with him in place, even though the Italian people despised him for their defeat it could at the very least create a sense of stability. \n\nInterestingly, Roberto Farinacci has expressed support for the Reich's takeover of Italy and called for a German friendly Italian collaboration government. With him in charge, we would be able to assert our control in the Italian peninsula even further. \n\nIt is up to the Fuhrer if he wants to directly create a new Reichskommissariat, give his old friend a chance, though in shame, or perhaps give Farinacci a chance?"

The SS has already began consolidating their control in the region and are now seeking legitimacy from Berlin. With shifting politics in Berlin, this would only complicates the already controversial situation. If we were to allow the formation, it would not only strengthen the Schutzstaffel like never seen before but also allows the SS to slowly shift away from the Reich and maybe even have the capabilities to influence global events. Disagreeing to their terms might drastically reduce the loyalty of the Schutzstaffel to the Reich. We are on borrowed time and it is time to finally decide the future of Burgundy."

He stated that the Great Leader demands the German Reich hand over the Attu Island. 'Wait, Attu Island? But why, the Fuhrer asked'. The man kept his silence.

Therefore, we lack the proper readiness to fully subjugate India under the Aryan Hakenkreuz without certain revolts and uprisings. The previously pure Aryans of the Indus Valley has been wiped out by centuries of conflicts, further weakening the Aryan blood spirit. Nevertheless, we have two options on how to tackle India. \n\nWe can either manage a whole united India, looks nice on paper but it will complicate the administration due to the collapse of the British system. \n\nOr, we could just split the region into three which would help the administrations of each Reichskolonie to supress revolts and exploit resources."

Crowds cheered on as the ceremony took place. \n\nNordstern ("Northern Star") is a city envisioned by Adolf Hitler to be the "German Singapore" that would put the real one in shame in terms of military capabilities. Hitler appointed his favorite architect, Albert Speer to lead the project. Materials from occupied territories aswell as enslaved labourers mainly those of POWs were extensively used to ensure the completion of the project. \n\nThe city was built in conjuction with a major Kriegsmarine naval base. This would undoubtedly give Germany unprecedented maritime control over the North Atlantic area, a move strongly supported by Grossadmirals Erich Raeder and Karl Donitz. The naval base is fully equipped with the greatest weaponry known to man, unrivaled in the global stage. \n\nThe city is a massive propaganda machine for the Reich, being the most sucessful metropolis to be built under the Reich. The city is able to house around 250000-300000 German inhabitants thanks to the 55000 residential houses built. An enormous art museum was also built, containing the great German works for the people to admire.

At this point the crew was about to give up and go back to Lhasa when all of a sudden one of them shouted 'There's a cavern down here!'. Everybody quickly gathered around the man and what they saw was stunning to say the least. A massive entrance which leads to a cavern. 'Could this be the resting place of Noah's Ark?' they wondered. One of them volunteered to go down the small entrance, with the help of a rope. As he descends below equipped with a camera and a torch, he reports the situation to his fellow crewmates. The rope was barely long enough but he made it. There he wandered around the dark cavern searching for something. At last, he found an ancient mural painting that closely resembles the one in Germany. As he looked on in awe, he noticed something. There's another entrance. It seems thought that it is blocked by a boulder. Realising there's nothing left, he quickly took pictures of the mural and called out to his crewmates to pick him up. After he ascended, he told his crewmates about what's down there. Surprised, they asked for the pictures he took. When they took a look, they were stunned. This is it. It must be. The guy then told the crewmates there's another entrance but it is blocked by a boulder. Thankfully, they brought a couple of explosives along with them."

Everybody looked at each other to see if someone dares to go in. But in the end everyone agreed to go in at the same time. Upon entering, they found a staircase which leads to a seemingly endless dark path. Cautiously descending, they began to wonder what could be down there. After 10 minutes, the staircase stopped and led to a pitch-black path. They pressed on and continue walking down the path until all of a sudden a glimpse of light shines. Confused, they slowly walked. At last, it wasn't the Noah's Ark that was shining. IT IS THE FUCKING HOLLOW EARTH. HOW THE FUCK IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE MEIN GOTT!!!

Situation in the Ordensstaat are developing by minutes as reports stated that a French rebellion has taken place in Reims, though recent reports has concluded to mass arrests. \n\nHeinrich Himmler, along with his loyal allies were sent to the infamous chamber known as the "Crimson Keep".

Inside was an armory of weapons with symbols of the black sun, remains of what was thought to be a last stand. Between who? We don't have a clear answer. \n\nVenturing further, a large monument stood in front of us. No one dared to go forward but me. I was dumb enough to go. As I approached the mysterious monument, suddenly a bright light emitted from it, blinding us temporarily.

He gave us all the informations he could gather prior to our arrival. Story goes, there is a powerful force contained inside a square box and it's located somewhere within the mountain ranges of Japan. After a day of resting and preparing, we met up with a local monastery monk. He told us more informations of this "artifact" and showed us the path leading to the cave entrance. \n\nAfter hours of trekking through the Japanese wilderness, we arrived at the entrance. It's an ordinary cave entrance, only with a metal gate built inside to prevent thieves from entering. The local monk warned us about the dangers lurking in the cave system but we obviously ignored his warning. Seeing us not paying attention, he proceeded to open the gate with the help of a key.

At this point the crew was about to give up and go back to Lhasa when all of a sudden one of them shouted 'There's a cavern down here!'. Everybody quickly gathered around the man and what they saw was stunning to say the least. A massive entrance which leads to a cavern. 'Could this be the resting place of Noah's Ark?' they wondered. One of them volunteered to go down the small entrance, with the help of a rope. As he descends below equipped with a camera and a torch, he reports the situation to his fellow crewmates. The rope was barely long enough but he made it. There he wandered around the dark cavern searching for something. At last, he found an ancient mural painting that closely resembles the one in Germany. As he looked on in awe, he noticed something. There's another entrance. It seems thought that it is blocked by a boulder. Realising there's nothing left, he quickly took pictures of the mural and called out to his crewmates to pick him up. After he ascended, he told his crewmates about what's down there. Surprised, they asked for the pictures he took. When they took a look, they were stunned. This is it. It must be. The guy then told the crewmates there's another entrance but it is blocked by a boulder. Thankfully, they brought a couple of explosives along with them."

Everybody looked at each other to see if someone dares to go in. But in the end everyone agreed to go in at the same time. Upon entering, they found a staircase which leads to a seemingly endless dark path. Cautiously descending, they began to wonder what could be down there. After 10 minutes, the staircase stopped and led to a pitch-black path. They pressed on and continue walking down the path until all of a sudden a glimpse of light shines. Confused, they slowly walked. At last, it wasn't the Noah's Ark that was shining. IT IS THE FUCKING HOLLOW EARTH. HOW THE FUCK IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE MEIN GOTT!!!

Obviously I didn't have one and I tried shooing him away but he was a persistent little bastard. He proceeded to screech at me and at that point my patient level was almost at its lowest. Luckily for the monkey, a guy came up and gave the monkey a lot of bananas. The monkey, happy with the tribute, took the bananas and sat on a couch and ate all of them. \n\n After the weird commotion, we continued our journey to Brazil. Eventually we landed in Sao Paolo. As we were walking our way to the nearby hotel to rest, there was a scene where a man wearing nothing but underwear holding a crowbar started arguing with a random confused pedestrian. As crowds began to gather, the underwear man got so angry that he bit the crowbar, much to everyone's dismay. Then, he sat down on the street and began crying like a baby. Not long after, the police arrived and took the man elsewhere. Turns out, the man is American and is from Florida. He is probably a victim of insanity, due to staying way too long in Brazil.

As we made our way out of the city, we met up with a Brazillian guide named Pedro and he led us to the beginning of the Amazon jungle. \n\nJungle-trekking through the Amazon was the worst experience I ever had. The mosquitos, snakes, spiders and all sorts of demonic creatures from hell made life worse. Thankfully after a few painful hours of trekking, we stopped and set up camp inside the jungle. \n\nWhile resting, I wondered if we did went to either Tibet or Japan.

Pedro, the guide told me a story about the legends of El Dorado, the city filled to the brims with golds. As my team listened in, suddenly we realised something. Where the hell is our captain? At the same time, one of us pointed out to a life jacket clearly from the boat. That fucker, he ditched the damn boat! But why though? \n\nAs confusing began rounding up, we were oblivious to one thing. What's in front of us? As we looked forward, to our horrors the river flows down...."

We survived off the wilderness of the Amazons and the little supplies we had left. \n\nOver the course of several days, we barely made it to the other side of the jungle.

The city is eerily quiet, devoid of life. There is not a single person living in the city yet the city remains intact. It's too good to be true.... Conveniently, we found an abandoned radio station.

 #### PEACE DEAL ####

 rkspeacedeal.1.d:0 "Our situation went from bad to utterly decimated. Our army is in shambles, the people are beginning to stray away from the central government, three of our major cities has been captured, and sadly pillaged to the ground. Sooner or later, the entire Slavic race will be annihilated and wiped off the face of the Earth by the Germanic hordes. Desperate time calls for desperate measures. We will negotiate a peace deal, under their terms and conditions. It may be the final nail in the coffin for us, but if that's the best of what we could get then we'll endure it. The Germans are demanding us withdraw west of the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan Line, so be it. We will retreat to Siberia, we might never see Moscow ever again. We will take the fight to their land... to their people... to their blood."
 rkspeacedeal.1.a:0 "Forgive us motherland..."

They have proposed a peace deal, in our terms - which all of the high commands have agreed for the Russians to retreat from the west of the AA Line (Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan). We have kicked the door, and now the entire structure has collapsed. However, some argues that we should advance all the way to the Urals and annhilate all of them completely. This would put us in an disadvantage as we still have a front in the West to deal with. Despite all of this, the Fuhrer...."

 #### USSR COLLAPSE EVENT ####
 
 rksplusussr.1.t:0 "Worrying news..."
 rksplusussr.1.d:0 "With our humiliating defeat in the Great Patriotic War, the people have begun to question the central government. A series of demonstration took places across the major cities in Siberia and while insignificant, it will undoubtedly grow larger overtime. Our special agents are still keeping a close eye on the civilian population but for how long? Currently, we are still the head of [Root.GetNameDefCap] - for now..."
 rksplusussr.1.a:0 "We have larger issues to be dealt with."
 
 rksplusussr.2.t:0 "Mass Protests Against the Government!"
 rksplusussr.2.d:0 "Recently, a huge fiery but mostly peaceful protest against our government were held throughout the nation. From Kazan all the way to Magadan, the people are fed up. It seems like we have lost the grip on the population. Soldiers are already on their way to the cities - we can only hope for the best."
 rksplusussr.2.a:0 "Right?"
 
 rksplusussr.3.t:0 "Protests turned Violent!"
 rksplusussr.3.d:0 "In the wake of our soldiers' reinforcement, the protesters have begun to entrench themselves and soon it turned violent - with protesters throwing whatever they could get their hands on to our soldiers. Unsurprisingly, our soldiers retaliated with gunshots. 4 people lost their lives that day - with 13 wounded."
 rksplusussr.3.a:0 "Ahhh this is bad!"
 
 rksplusussr.4.t:0 "Armoury Raid!"
 rksplusussr.4.d:0 "Our troubles have only gotten worse. Disturbing reports shown that an armoury was recently raided by the protesters in the wake of the killings of four of their comrades. This incident was only reported earlier this morning - to which some experts presumed that the armoury was raided under the darkness of night. A total of a thousand guns are missing and they could be anywhere - very likely to be used to against us."
 rksplusussr.4.a:0 "Not good!"
 
 rksplusussr.5.t:0 "National Emergency Declaration"
 rksplusussr.5.d:0 "The ongoing violent protests happening throughout the country has turned into a full scale revolution. Many are taking their sides while others try their best to disassociate themselves from the extremists. The government has declared a nation-scale lockdown and ordered all civilians to be home on curfew or else. However, this has only put more woods onto the flame. Gunfights are common in major cities and our troops have began deserting and joining others in their causes. Our collapse is imminent."
 rksplusussr.5.a:0 "Oh noooo!"
 
 rksplusussr.6.t:0 "Kazakhstan declares Independence!"
 rksplusussr.6.d:0 "The ongoing chaos in our country has convinced the Kazakhs to declare indepedence to protect its people, according to their representatives. Our soldiers are busy dealing with the rebellion and are beyond exhausted to stop this declaration. Our grip in Eurasia is collapsing and this won't be the last of it."
 rksplusussr.6.a:0 "Fine..."
 rksplusussr.6.b:0 "Oyan Qazaqstan!"
 
 rksplusussr.7.t:0 "Islamic Republic of Turkestan declares Independence!"
 rksplusussr.7.d:0 "With the Kazakhs having successfully declared indepedence, this gave enough confidence for the rest of the Turkic people in Central Asia to declare their own state under the name of the Islamic Republic of Turkestan. We doubt however whether the Pamir garrison would react too kindly to this situation..."
 rksplusussr.7.a:0 "We can't even get to them anyway..."
 rksplusussr.7.b:0 "Allahu akbar!"
 
 rksplusussr.8.t:0 "Turkestan Soviet Republic Emerges!"
 rksplusussr.8.d:0 "In response to Kazakh and Islamic Turkestan's indepedences, the remaining Communist Party members in Turkestan declared a seperate communist Soviet Republic in the Eastern part of Turkestan. With them essentially cut off from us, it would be hard to support them. The Pamir Garrison has vowed to 'defend the Republic until the Union returns.'"
 rksplusussr.8.a:0 "We will be back..."
 rksplusussr.8.b:0 "Ura!!"
 
 rksplusussr.9.t:0 "[From.From.GetLeader] assassinated!"
 rksplusussr.9.d:0 "Under the darkness of night, our leader [From.From.GetLeader] has been murdered cold-blooded. Investigation are taking place but given the circumstances with the riots, it is going rather slow. Nonetheless, a burial ceremony was held early in the morning. Upon receiving the news, some people were shocked but a concerning majority cheered on. The stability of our country goes lower than ever."
 rksplusussr.9.a:0 "The Red Army will take full control!"
 rksplusussr.9.b:0 "The Emergency Government will take full control!"
 
 rksplusussr.10.t:0 "Occupy Transamur?"
 rksplusussr.10.d:0 "Our intelligence has suggested that the situation in Russia is terrible, with massive riots and uprisings throughout the nation. Luckily for us, this has spawned a rare opportunity that's too hard to miss. The occupation of Transamur. We always had an ambition there, we briefly occupied it during the Russian Civil War and now we can take back what was once ours. \n There are concerns whether the Russian will retaliates though this seems very unlikely given their current situation. A dice on the world map will decide the fate of the people of Transamur."
 rksplusussr.10.a:0 "March onwards! (Take all)"
 rksplusussr.10.b:0 "March onwards! (Transfer Out.Manchuria to Manchukuo)"
 rksplusussr.10.c:0 "I'm scared, mommy!"
 
 rksplusussr.11.t:0 "Transamur Occupied!"
 rksplusussr.11.d:0 "In a scummy decision, the Japanese has decided that it's best to steal Transamur from us. They knew our situation and took full advantage of it. Our commands in Vladivostok were overwhelmed and forced to surrender. This is the breaking point. A foreign exploitation. The beginning of the end."
 rksplusussr.11.a:0 "As if it couldn't get any worse!"
 
 rksplusussr.12.t:0 "Tannu Tuva declares indepedence!"
 rksplusussr.12.d:0 "Tannu Tuva, a nation that's in de facto Russian rule has declared itself independent from the rest of Russia. The reason is clear as the ruler doesn't want his people to suffer any longer. The higher-ups have simply called this move a "bluff" and moved forward with their tasks. The future of Tannu Tuva is uncertain."
 rksplusussr.12.a:0 "Tannu what?"
 
 rksplusussr.13.t:0 "Mongolia cut ties!"
 rksplusussr.13.d:0 "Mongolia, a country that was previously heavily under our sphere has cut ties with us and declared a "free and a united nation"."
 rksplusussr.13.a:0 "Moving on.."
 
 rksplusussr.14.t:0 "White Russians have taken the Far East!"
 rksplusussr.14.d:0 "Without warning, the White Russians have declared a new front against the central government based in Irkutsk! Their activies were recently noticed by our intelligence agency, however we were a little to late to take action as they've already commenced their operation. With the Far East lost, we are bound to be wiped out."
 rksplusussr.14.a:0 "Damn you!"
 rksplusussr.14.b:0 "For Mother Russia!"
 
 rksplusussr.15.t:0 "Concerning reports..."
 rksplusussr.15.d:0 "Our capital was recently shocked by a confrontation between the army and the angry populace. The people are demanding us to resign immediately and allow a democratic election to take place. Still, our army has proven to them that the central government aren't willing to talk. Therefore, a few dissidents have discussed the possibility of a Siberian Republic, to replace the current one in Sverdlovsk."
 rksplusussr.15.a:0 "Nonsense!"
 
 rksplusussr.16.t:0 "Declaration of a Siberian Republic"
 rksplusussr.16.d:0 "Today, history was made. The protesters stormed into the Parliament in Sverdlovsk. After securing the location, the leaders of the movement stepped up and declared a new Siberian Republic that shall follow "free and democratic values for all men". Following afterwards, a massive clashes occured in the city. The protesters, motivated by the words of the proclamation faced the army with all force. They managed to kick out the central government from the city and the wave of revolution reached all the way to Krasnoyarsk. Siberia is free to decide its own path now, though with threats from the east as the White Russians looked on. Meanwhile, the central government managed to flee west of the Urals and settled in Kazan."
 rksplusussr.16.a:0 "Bastards!"
 rksplusussr.16.b:0 "Under the white and green banner of the tundra!"
 
 rksplusussr.17.t:0 "The End"
 rksplusussr.17.d:0 "The end has arrived. The country is no longer the powerhouse it was. Kazan was the best place, but it's not the greatest. Everyday, the Germans bombard the city, leaving only dust and rubbles to scavenge. Zhukov has decided that enough is enough. He has decided to form the West Russian Liberation Front, one final stronghold against German expansionism. We will endure. We will be back. Dark is the night, my love."
