# Division template historical names system. Is a new method of naming the divisions based on the names-group assigned to it's template.
# If we run out of all historical names, the names will be assigned in the old way.
#
# Each group has a made up tag. Use it if you want to append more, or replace existing names with the extra txt files (modding).
#
# for_countries - lists all countries that can use it. If empty, or entire tag is missing, all countries in the world can use it.
#
# can_use - is a trigger that locks/unlocks the group under specific circumstances. The trigger is in a country scope.
#
# division_types - is a list of tokens to corresponding unit types. A player can in fact use any group of names for a div.template
#                  however this tag is a helper for an automated choice (for AI, or if the group must switch on it's own, because
#                  for example the current one is no longer available due to the can_use trigger saying so).
#                  In automated choice, the division template must have at least 1 of the following types for it to be chosen.
#
# fallback_name - Is going to be used if we run out of the scripted historical names. If you want to use the old division naming
#                 mechanics to be used for fallbacks, then just skip this option.
#
# unordered - It's a list of historical division names that did not have a number. Regardless if such names happened in history or not
#             this option is available here mainly for a mods.
#
# ordered - Is a list of all historical names. 
#           Numbers must start from 1 and up. 
#           Numbers can't repeat in one scope.
#           If you script the name for this group, at the same number (for example in a mod in another file), the name will be override.
#           All arguments between the brackets must be separated by spaces. Each argument is wrapped in "quotas".
#           1st argument = The name. It must contain either: 
#                          %d (for decimal number placement)
#                          %s (for string number placement - ROMAN numbers like XIV).
#           2nd argument is optional = A localizable text describing this historical division. The text will be visible in the tooltip
#                                      where you choose the historical division name.
#           3rd argument is optional = An URL preferably pointing to the WIKI. It's a future feature that is not currently working in
#                                      the current game version.

		# omitted noncombat "shadow divisions" and holding units raised to fill up combat units
		# ad hoc divisional sized Kampfgruppe such as "Division von Broich" deleted as their temporary existence was highly dependent on unique historical circumstances that are not guaranteed to be replicated in game
		# deleted Landesschützen, training/holding divisions with a super short life and no combat record, "infantry divisions" that were ad hoc collections of fortress/coast defense units in Norway, etc
		# deleted some 500-series Grenadier Divisions as they were almost immediately converted to Volksgrenadier
		# deleted Sturm-Division Rhodos as it was made from a collection of Aegean island garrison troops not guaranteed to exist in game
		# deleted 999. leichte Afrika-Division as Germany is not guaranteed to go to Africa
		# deleted 99. leichte as it was soon converted in to 7. Gebirgs-Division
		# added 1-3. Marine-Infanterie-Division to the infantry list, as they were ground combat units formed from surplus naval personnel at the end of the war, not "Marines" in the proper sense. 11. and 16. Divisions were deleted as they were most likely camouflage/deception units that never saw combat.
